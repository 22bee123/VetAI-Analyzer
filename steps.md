Clear Navigation: Ensure easy navigation between different sections of the app.

Feedback Mechanism: Include a feedback system for users to rate the app's performance.

Step 3: Develop the Backend with Express.js and TypeScript
API Endpoints: Create endpoints to handle user input and integrate with the Gemini API for symptom analysis.

Database Integration: Use MongoDB to store user input and analysis results.

Security Measures: Implement robust security measures to protect user data.

Step 4: Integrate Gemini API for AI Analysis
API Integration: Use the Gemini API to analyze symptoms and provide AI-driven diagnosis suggestions.

Data Processing: Handle data returned from the Gemini API and display it in the app.

Step 5: Implement Administrative Features
User Management: Implement user registration and login features using Express.js and MongoDB.

Data Privacy: Ensure all user and pet data is securely stored and protected.

Notification System: Develop a system to notify users of updates or potential health risks.
